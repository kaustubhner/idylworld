                            When you hear and read about adventurous explorers
                            of the world, you want to be that. But, honestly
                            there is no magic wand to transform you into what
                            you are not and nor is it needed or recommended. A
                            person looking to get new experiences or creating a
                            new lifestyle, wants to try night-hike but is too
                            sensible to throw caution to the wind. IW has
                            closely worked with botanists, outdoors explorers
                            and locals and over the years has created a safe
                            bubble where humans, animals, flora/fauna can
                            coexist and get their share of unadulterated nature.

                            Sometimes expressing yourself through dance, music
                            or poetry is far more authentic, effective and
                            meaningful than speaking. The non professional
                            artists are always intrigued & conscious in equal

                            grandparent. You tirelessly tell your children
                            stories of events that happened and people you met
                            on your way to the templeâ€¦. The mythological stories
                            your favorite uncle/aunt shared sitting under a tree
                            outside the temple. The overnight jaagran/satsang at
                            your local temple, you were allowed to stay up the
                            whole night for, when you were little. These
                            experiences make us who we are, then why limit
                            yourself by sharing stories with your children. Why
                            not provide opportunities for different generations
                            of your family to come together to enjoy such
