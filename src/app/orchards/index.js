                            One acre at Idylworld would allow any resident to be exceptionally self-sufficient.
                            Residents can grow the familyâ€™s worth of fruits & veggies, house a large solar array and
                            windmill for energy, store excess wind or solar as hydroelectric energy, harvest rainwater
                            to fulfill all their needs, grow many trees, build a house (or two), and still have enough
                            left over for private walking trails and nature nooks!

                                secluded property, you can have all the peace and quiet that your heart desires.

                                energy bills of your home by becoming less reliant on artificial cooling.
